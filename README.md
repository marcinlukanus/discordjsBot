## About discordjsBot
This is a bot for the Discord platform that will assist me with managing one of my Discord servers. I am creating it to automate some common processes as well as to gain experience working with a Javascript library.

## Features
This bot will be able to respond to users who mention it, perform some commands with and without API calls to third parties, and update roles for users.
