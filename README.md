## About discordjsBot
This is a bot for the Discord platform that will assist me with managing one of my Discord servers. I am creating it to automate some common processes as well as to gain experience working with a Javascript library.

## Current Features
This bot welcomes new users to my Discord server and provides a RichEmbed message to encourage users to add additional roles who request them via two commands, `!rank` and `!role`.

## Future Features
I would like to add some additional functionality such as performing commands with API calls to third parties
