## About discordjsBot
This is a bot for the Discord platform that will assist me with managing one of my Discord servers. I am creating it to automate some common processes as well as to gain experience working with a Javascript library.

## Current Features
This bot welcomes new users to my Discord server and provides a RichEmbed message to encourage users to add additional roles who request them via two commands, `!rank` and `!role`. Users can also remove roles with the `!remove` command.

I also was able to deploy this Node.js app onto Heroku to keep the bot online as often as possible.

## Future Features
I would like to add some additional functionality such as performing commands with API calls to third parties. 

I also plan to implement a way to generate random teams of users for games that are played in my Discord server, to alleviate any hassle with determining teams.
